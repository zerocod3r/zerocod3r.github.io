                    <h1>We can do better than Signal</h1>
                    <h2 class="subtitle">Centralized silos are never the solution</h2>
                    <p>Signal is possibly the most recommended pro-privacy instant
                        communication app &mdash; one that was commonplace in the hacker community,
                        and has now gained a lot of mainstream traction, thanks to WhatsApp
                        deciding to screw its userbase over. It certainly presents a more
                        compelling alternative than others in the same space, like WhatsApp
                        itself, Telegram, etc. They engineered the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol" rel="nofollow">Signal
                            Protocol</a>, which has
                        found its way into other messaging systems, and has been the base for
                        the likes of OMEMO and Matrix.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
                        While I admire the tech behind
                        Signal, I still believe we can do better, and we ought to.</p>

                    <p>I have a few gripes with Signal &mdash; the biggest of them all is it&rsquo;s
                        centralized, and in the US no less. This alone makes it not that
                        different from WhatsApp &mdash; we&rsquo;re simply moving from one silo to another.
                        What&rsquo;s to say that Signal will uphold its values, continue operating
                        <em>and</em> evade censorship and potential compromise? To top it off, they&rsquo;re
                        becoming a fairly high value target off late. And if that isn&rsquo;t
                        convincing enough, Signal&rsquo;s massive outage lasting nearly a day<sup class="footnote-ref"
                            id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
                        should be enough evidence against centralization. Further, Signal is
                        known to use AWS<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> as their
                        cloud provider &mdash; what if another
                        Parler<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> happens and the rug is
                        pulled from under Signal&rsquo;s feet?
                    </p>

                    <p>A common defense in favor of Signal is, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all open source!&rdquo;.
                        Sure is, but on what basis do I trust them? I don&rsquo;t mean to sound
                        conspiratorial, but what&rsquo;s to say that the server in production hasn&rsquo;t
                        been backdoored? In fact, the <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server"
                            rel="nofollow">Signal server
                            code</a> hasn&rsquo;t even been
                        updated since April 2020. You&rsquo;re telling me it&rsquo;s undergone <em>no</em> changes?</p>

                    <p>Another response I usually see is &ldquo;But Signal is all we have!&rdquo;. While
                        that is somewhat true &mdash; at least by the metric of &ldquo;secure messengers
                        your granny can use&rdquo;, there are some promising alternatives who are
                        especially focused on decentralizing E2EE communications.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow">Matrix</a>: Matrix has improved a whole lot,
                            and I
                            like that they&rsquo;re working to disprove that end-to-end encryption
                            cannot be decentralized<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://getsession.org/" rel="nofollow">Session</a>: While it involves some
                            cryptoshit,
                            and hasn&rsquo;t been verified yet, it&rsquo;s an interesting alternative to keep
                            an eye out for.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>All things said, Signal is the shiniest turd we have &mdash; it fits most
                        threat models, and does the job alright; I will continue to use it.
                        However, here&rsquo;s something to think about: while privacy preserving tech
                        is commendable, does it have to come at the cost of user freedoms? Hint:
                        it doesn&rsquo;t, and it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
