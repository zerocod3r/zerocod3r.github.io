{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Little things make big days.</h2>\n<p>My hardware consists of a gaming laptop Acer Predator Helios 300 which I use it for all things, work, entertainment, coding etc. It has a 15 inch IPS display and under the hood loaded with processor i5 8300h and GTX 1050ti graphics processor, which helps in pushing stable 100fps in Valorant and Apex Legends.</p>\n<p>I also use an external monitor that is LG 22inch 75Hz with IPS display. Colors are too good that VSCode color schemes looks really nice.</p>\n<p>Being a mechanical keyboard fan, I am a proud owner of GK61 mechanical keyboard with Gatreon Red Switches. It is one of the cheapest and best mechanical keyboards out there with custom RGB settings. I might try out another switches like Kalih, holy panda, with it.</p>\n<h2>OS</h2>\n<p>I have configured dual boot os Windows along with Ubuntu on my laptop. Most of the work I do in Ubuntu and use Windows for gaming only. Everything is vanilla falvour, I don't like adding more fancy things to os to make it look better. I use VSCode for writing scripts, small codes, etc. Extensions makes things simpler. I use PyCharm for bulding Django projects, only because of excellent debugger.</p>\n<p>I might be building a mini ITX Battlestation in future, will update about it. Till then keep reading futher posts :)</p>\n<p>Questions or comments?
